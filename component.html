        <p>The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. -Nelson Mandela</p>
        <p>Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living
            with the results of other people's thinking. -Steve Jobs</p>
        <p>If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success. -James

        <h4>Langston Hughes, “Harlem”</h4>
        <p>What happens to a dream deferred?<br>
    
            Does it dry up <br>
            like a raisin in the sun? <br>
            <br>
            Or fester like a sore— <br>
            And then run? <br>
            <br>
            Does it stink like rotten meat? <br>
            <br>
            Or crust and sugar over— <br>
            like a syrupy sweet? <br>
            <br>
            Maybe it just sags <br>
            like a heavy load. <br>
    
            Or does it explode?
